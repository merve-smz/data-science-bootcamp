    "For this Capstone Project, assume that you have been approached by a small\n",
    "financial company and asked to create a program that allows the user to access\n",
    "two different financial calculators: an investment calculator and a home loan\n",
    "repayment calculator.\n",
    "- Create a new Python file in this folder called finance_calculators.py.\n",
    "- At the top of the file include the line: import math.\n",
    "- Write the code that will do the following:\n",
    "1. The user should be allowed to choose which calculation they want to do.\n",
    "The first output that the user sees when the program runs should look like\n",
    "this :\n",
    "investment - to calculate the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment\n",
    "bond - to calculate the amount you'll have to pay on a home loan\n",
    "Enter either 'investment' or 'bond' from the menu above to proceed:\n",
    "2. How the user capitalises their selection should not affect how the\n",
    "program proceeds. i.e. ‘Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or ‘investment’, ‘Investment’,\n",
    "‘INVESTMENT’, etc., should all be recognised as valid entries. If the user\n",
    "doesn’t type in a valid input, show an appropriate error message.\n",
    "3. If the user selects ‘investment’, do the following:\n",
    "- Ask the user to input:\n",
    "  - The amount of money that they are depositing.\n",
    "  - The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest\n",
    "rate should be entered — don’t worry about having to deal with the\n",
    "added ‘%’, e.g. The user should enter 8 and not 8%.\n",
    "  - The number of years they plan on investing.\n",
    "  - Then ask the user to input if they want “simple” or “compound”\n",
    "interest, and store this in a variable called interest. Depending on\n",
    "whether or not they typed “simple” or “compound”, output the\n",
    "appropriate amount that they will get back after the given period,\n",
    "at the specified interest rate. See below for the formula to be used:"
